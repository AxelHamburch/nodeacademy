## Running LND

In this section we will finally run LND and achieve our course objective! We are going to learn how to run LND as a background process, unlock the wallet, check its status and retrieve important information. We are also going to go through how to deposit Bitcoin into your node, and how to open a channel from the command line.

### Useful resources:

- [First Steps with LND](https://docs.lightning.engineering/lightning-network-tools/lnd/first-steps-with-lnd)
- [Terminal Node Ranking](https://terminal.lightning.engineering/)
- [Amboss](https://amboss.space/)

### Make sure Bitcoin is running and synced

Before we can run litd, we will have to make sure Bitcoin Core is running and synced on our machine. We can do that by running:

```shell
bitcoin-cli --getinfo
```

We'll want to see a line such as `Verification progress: 99.9995%` in the output. If the verification progress is stalled or the command returns an error, we will need to go back to [Run Bitcoin](/install-bitcoin) or we will simply have to wait.


### Run litd

As we want litd to keep running in the background even when we close the Terminal window, we will append `nohup` to the command.

```shell
nohup litd > /dev/null 2> ~/.lnd/err.log &
```

Press `Enter` and observe the logs. It might be very helpful at this stage to open a second Terminal window, ssh into your server and simply keep the logs running in one window, while we interact with the program in another. The LND logs can be very noisy, so we may have to occasionally restart the logs if they appear stuck.

```shell
tail -f ~/.lnd/logs/bitcoin/mainnet/lnd.log
```

### Create a wallet

Most likely, our LND logs will eventually stop at the following line:

```

As this is our first time opening LND, we will generate a new wallet. Ideally, use the second Terminal window and run

```shell
lncli create
```

At first, we will be asked for a wallet password. Choose a good password, ideally from your password manager. You will have to enter it everytime you start up LND.

```
Do you have an existing cipher seed mnemonic or extended master root key you want to use?
Enter 'y' to use an existing cipher seed mnemonic, 'x' to use an extended master root key 
or 'n' to create a new seed (Enter y/x/n):
```

Next, we are asked if we already have a seed. Unless we are restoring an old, **inactive** node, we will generate a new seed by pressing `n`.

Optionally, you are asked if you want to encrypt your seed phrase. If you opt to do so, don't forget to back up this encryption phrase, too! Otherwise, just leave the field empty and press `Enter`.

Write down the seed phrase, in your password manager or ideally on a piece of paper and store it well. You are not able to retrieve the seed phrase later from your node.

Your node will now begin to sync to the B

This shouldn't take very long as we only just generated our wallet, and LND will only need to scan through the most recent blocks to see if we already made an on-chain transaction to our node.

Next our node is going to sync to the network graph, meaning it is going to download a list of all Lightning Network channels in existence.

```

We can always follow the progress.

```shell
lncli getinfo
```

We'll be looking for the following lines in the output to tell us when we are fully synced to the network graph:

```
    "synced_to_chain": true,
    "synced_to_graph": true
```

You can also run this command to see progress:

```shell
lncli getnetworkinfo
```

For a fully synced node, it will look something like this. Note that no two Lightning Nodes are exactly the same, they will always have a slightly different view of the network based on how old they are, how they are configured and where in the graph they are located.

```

    "graph_diameter": 12,

    "max_out_degree": 126,

    "median_channel_size_sat": "1000000",
    "num_zombie_chans": "240377"
}
```

## Course Objective

Once our node is synced to chain and graph, we will grab it's URI. A URI is a bit like a URL, it contains your node's public key before the `@` symbol, and how to reach it.

### Get the node URI

We're looking for the `uri` output of `lncli getinfo`. Your node may have more than one URI, but it should have at least one to be reachable from the outside. It is also possible to run a node without it being reachable from the outside, but this makes having incoming channels more complicated. Below is an example of a node with an IPv6, IPv4 and Tor URI.

```
    "uris": [
        "02e64da75794703de72e9a8d6394747bc40fd72d0121c5dda6c1bd845939e30bb7@[2602:ffb6:4:c927:f816:3eff:fea0:ef40]:9735",
        "02e64da75794703de72e9a8d6394747bc40fd72d0121c5dda6c1bd845939e30bb7@172.81.179.14:9735",
        "02e64da75794703de72e9a8d6394747bc40fd72d0121c5dda6c1bd845939e30bb7@235p6kn5odzvuvx4qmrzdf47xh2pjzfw36rnhbguzl3ym4ebcfodjuyd.onion:9735"
    ]
```

### Generate your first invoice

We are going to generate an invoice with the following command. You can see below how we define the amount, a memo and an expiration time in seconds, which in this case is set to one month.

```shell
lncli addinvoice --memo "nodeacademy course objective" --amt 210000 --expiry 2592000
```

The relevant output will be the "payment request", and looks like this:

`lnbc2100u1pj8lv5ypp5l0s7swnxtvwwgut2p53ju3gq0umhzqurrcug3t99akj3vq2q0wyqdp0dehkgefqv93kzer9d4ujqcm0w4e8xefqda3x5etrw35hvegcqzzsxq9z0rgqsp55205qjtmhd6w0uja5sk6evx3hfm2s8sv48jpsye6xvr3jmtaet4q9qyyssq7qhlh0dxpnpzez3e2hz2950u0w9pyzywkxvrsnnpc8nuh4nuutkxx39j9fsknduq2lxrrt66q2k7n9v4f2m23ezve5r5negfqe7c0zgqw060zg`

## Useful commands in LND

Get basic information about your active daemon, such as if it's running, synced to the main chain, your node URI, etc.

```shell
lncli getinfo
```

Generates a new onchain Taproot address for your node. You can use it to deposit funds to your node.

```shell
lncli newaddress p2tr
```

Shows your on-chain balance:

```shell
lncli walletbalance
```

Opens a channel. Don't forget to substitute nodekey and the node's URI! You can find ranked nodes to open channels to on [LightningTerminal](https://terminal.lightning.engineering/).

```shell
lncli openchannel --node_key <nodekey> --connect <ip address or onion>:<port> --local_amt 2200000 --sat_per_vbyte 21
```

You can see whether a channel is currently opening or closing with:

```shell
lncli pendingchannels
```

You can see all your channels with:

```shell
lncli listchannels
```

You can pay an invoice with:

```shell
lncli payinvoice <invoice>
```

You can make an onchain payment with:

```shell
lncli sendcoins
```

You can see if your node forwarded any payments with:

```shell
lncli fwdinghistory
```

You can sign a message with:

```shell
lncli signmessage
```

You can see all available commands with:

```shell
lncli help
```

You can turn off LND with:

```shell
lncli stop
```
